# MyTraining - Web Development Fundamentals

A collection of mini-projects built while learning the fundamentals of web development with JavaScript. This repository documents my journey through core web technologies and serves as a reference for basic concepts and implementations.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This is my personal learning playground where I practice and experiment with:
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Styling, layouts, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - DOM manipulation, events, and core programming concepts
- **Web APIs** - Browser features and interactions

Each project focuses on specific concepts and gradually builds up complexity as skills develop.


## 🚀 Getting Started

These projects are simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications that run directly in the browser.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) if you want to explore the code

### Running the Projects

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAZ110/MyTraining.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd MyTraining
```

3. Open any project's `index.html` file directly in your browser, or use a local development server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server
```

4. Browse to `http://localhost:8000` and navigate to individual project folders
